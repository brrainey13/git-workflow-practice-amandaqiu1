## Comments
With the launch of Meta and the Metaverse, tech companies are starting to develop ar/vr teachnology. Apple is taking a different approach from Facebook in that it is prioritizing security and privacy, which is the main concern with Facebook/Meta. Tim Cook seems to be hesitant to expand into AR/VR development and wants to focus on transparency rather than diving right in. The metaverse is still in its most early phases and it could either be recieved extremely well and change how we live our daily lives or fail and eventually fade out. It will be interesting to see the range of technologies that will develop from these companies out of innovation or competition.
